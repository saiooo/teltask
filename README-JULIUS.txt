## I been wondering about how to structure categories better to have them with parent Ids, or from beginning have a tree with subcategories array inside.
 -- As a general thought I was thinking that most likely from back-end I would get categories with parent Ids (?)
 -- (?) To have categories as a tree initially (with subcategories), probably I would have avoided flat & unflat array methods.
